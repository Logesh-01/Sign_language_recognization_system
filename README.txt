Description : 

				This project aims to develop a prototype system for real-time sign language recognition and conversion into text format. Sign language is a vital mode of communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. However, there is a gap in bridging the communication divide between sign language users and those who do not understand sign language. The proposed system will utilize computer vision techniques and machine learning to recognize signs made by a user wearing a wearable device equipped with 5 Flex sensors and Combined 3 axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer. The recognized signs will then be converted into text format and displayed on a screen using Neural Network Algorithm. This technology has the potential to facilitate better communication and inclusivity for sign language users. 



Hardware:

	# Flex Sensor
	# MPU 6050
	# Arduino nano

Software:
	
	# Arduino IDE
	# Python

Sechmatics:
	
	# Located in Harware/Schematics

Test:

	# Testing files which allows to train the model are also added which is located in Test/

Further Works:

	# I have made the test cases for upto the letter "F" with 3 test results for each case which is to not sufficient to get higher with this testing file I able to get an accuracy of 77.2%, With further more testing files and complete data sets the accuracy should be increased. Next for the displaying purpose I have decided to make an web page which will display the words that the sensor currently reading and it is still in progress.
